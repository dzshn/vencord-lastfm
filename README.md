# LastFMRichPresence (Vencord port)

This plugin lets you show what you're listening to on Last.fm, which is not
limited to just spotify. This plugin is my attempt at reviving
[dimden's BetterDiscord version](https://github.com/dimdenGD/LastFMRichPresence),
which no longer works because of Discord changes a while ago.
